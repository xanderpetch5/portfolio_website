      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>My passion for software began early in life, using programmes like Scratch to create basic games. Being able to solve problems creatively without there being one concrete solution is mainly what intrigued me.</p>

        <h3>Progress Through Academics</h3>
        <p>During secondary school, I developed many skills to help my understanding of computing; using microcontrollers and other electronics showed me the tangible impact of my coding. I was introduced to Python, which remains my favourite language. At A-levels, I delved into complex programming practices like Object-Oriented Programming and distinguished between other paradigms.</p>
        <p>In my first year of university, I gained experience working in teams for larger programming projects, understanding real-life practices of software engineers in the industry, and deepening my programming abilities.</p>

        <h3>Progress Outside Academics</h3>
        <p>Outside academic study, I continued to complete coding projects, which you can see on my projects page. I also attended a five-day residential course on software engineering and webinars on cybersecurity, solidifying my interest in software engineering as my future career.</p>
